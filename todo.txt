# TODOs
Scrape in the autocomplete form VDF for functions etc from fmac and HCSSmac
Highlight variable names in functions and procedures correctly
Search within scope or symbol.
Make this display correctly: Class Activity_DataDictionary is a HCSS_DataDictionary | And this: 	Procedure Set Main_File Integer iFile

meta â€” the meta scope is generally used to markup larger parts of the document. For example the entire line which declares a function would be meta.function and the subsets would be storage.type, entity.name.function, variable.parameter etc. and only the latter would be styled. Sometimes the meta part of the scope will be used only to limit the more general element that is styled, most of the time meta scopes are however used in scope selectors for activation of bundle items. For example in Objective-C there is a meta scope for the interface declaration of a class and the implementation, allowing the same tab-triggers to expand differently, depending on context.

Put keyword selection in the syntax.

# BIG TODO Ideas
Double clicking package name opens the file in sublime
work on a build script for Sublime for VDF
pipe error to sublime after a build
Build a Object based tree sidebar (one version just based on code folding etc)
Make command, go to definite in file -- make the command check if they are using sublime text 3

# Since Last Commit
CD_Object doesn't select as a symbol in the project, do this for other unidentified symbols as well.
Global Symbol find to work in VDF

# Tips
Use  (?-i) to turn off case insensitivity
Use (?i) to turn on case insensitivity
